# Third party stubs

If you need third party stubs you can place them here. If that is not the case you can delete this directory and remove the line `mypy_path = third_party_stubs` from the [`mypy.ini`](../mypy.ini) as well as from the `exclude`d directories of `find_packages` within [`setup.py`](../setup.py).
