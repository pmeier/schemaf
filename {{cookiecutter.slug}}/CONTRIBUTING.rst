Contributing guide lines
========================

We appreciate all contributions. If you are planning to contribute bug-fixes or
documentation improvements, please open a
`pull request (PR) <{{cookiecutter.url}}/pulls>`_
without further discussion. If you planning to contribute new features, please open an
`issue <{{cookiecutter.url}}/issues>`_
and discuss the feature with us first.

Every PR is subjected to multiple checks that it has to pass before it can be merged.
The checks are performed by `tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ . You can
install it alongside all other development requirements with

.. code-block:: sh

  cd ${{cookiecutter.package.upper()}}_ROOT
  pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

Below you can find details and instructions how to run the checks locally.


Code format and linting
-----------------------

``{{cookiecutter.slug}}`` uses `isort <https://timothycrosley.github.io/isort/>`_ to sort the
imports, `black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ to format the code, and
`flake8 <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_ to enforce
`PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ compliance.

Furthermore, ``{{cookiecutter.slug}}`` is `PEP561 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0561/>`_
compliant and checks the type annotations with `mypy <http://mypy-lang.org/>`_ .

To format your code run

.. code-block:: sh

  cd ${{cookiecutter.package.upper()}}_ROOT
  tox -e format

.. note::

  The formatting with ``isort``, ``black``, as well as other minor utilities can be
  performed by `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ before every commit.
  ``pre-commit`` is installed as development requirement. To enable this behavior run

  .. code-block:: sh

    cd ${{cookiecutter.package.upper()}}_ROOT
    pre-commit install

To run the full lint check locally run

.. code-block:: sh

  cd ${{cookiecutter.package.upper()}}_ROOT
  tox -e lint


Tests
-----

``pystiche`` uses `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/>`_ to run the test suite.
You can run it locally with

.. code-block:: sh

  cd ${{cookiecutter.package.upper()}}_ROOT
  tox

.. note::

  ``{{cookiecutter.slug}}`` adds the following custom options with the
  corresponding ``@pytest.mark.*`` decorators:
  - ``--skip-large-download``: ``@pytest.mark.large_download``
  - ``--skip-slow``: ``@pytest.mark.slow``
  - ``--run-flaky``: ``@pytest.mark.flaky``

  Options prefixed with ``--skip`` are run by default and skipped if the option is
  given. Options prefixed with ``--run`` are skipped by default and run if the option
  is given.

  These options are passed through ``tox`` if given after a ``--`` flag. For example,
  the CI invocation command is equivalent to:

  .. code-block:: sh

    cd ${{cookiecutter.package.upper()}}_ROOT
    tox -- --skip-large-download


Documentation
-------------

To build the html and latex documentation locally, run

.. code-block:: sh

  cd ${{cookiecutter.package.upper()}}_ROOT
  tox -e docs
